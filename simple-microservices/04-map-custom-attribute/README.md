The active selection json:"age" is a struct field tag in Go, used to specify how a struct field should be encoded to or decoded from JSON. This tag is part of Go's encoding/json package, which provides functionality for working with JSON data.

In Go, struct field tags are used to add metadata to struct fields. These tags are placed within backticks () immediately after the field declaration. The json:"age"tag indicates that when the struct is marshaled to JSON or unmarshaled from JSON, the corresponding JSON key for this field should be"age"`.

The use of struct field tags like `json:"age"` allows for more control over the JSON encoding and decoding process, enabling you to customize the JSON representation of your structs. 

This is particularly useful when working with JSON data that has specific key names or when you need to ensure compatibility with external APIs.
